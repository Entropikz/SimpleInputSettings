# Simple Input Settings
	A simple, yet elegant solution for implementing a modular input binding widget in your project.
	
## FEATURES

	• Entirely done in blueprints!
		- Just in case you need to make changes, the entire system is made using blueprints to make it easy!
	
	• No programming required!
		- The entire system is built with data tables, so you don't have to touch a single widget or blueprint!
	
	• Multiple Lists
		- This can help you separate input to be less confusing for your user.
		- For example, on list can contain character input settings, and another can contain vehicle input settings.

	• Multiple Categories
		- This gives you the ability to filter your input bind keys.

	• Modifier key support
		- The system supports built in engine modifiers (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Cmd)
		- The system can handle multiple modifiers at once.

	• Add new bindings
		- If desired, your user can add new action or axis mappings. They can even adjust the scale of the axis value!
